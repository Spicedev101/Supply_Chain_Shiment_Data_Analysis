# An Analysis of Supply Chain Shipment Pricing for Medical Supplies

## Introduction

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is a U.S. agency at the forefront of global development and humanitarian initiatives. Its mission includes saving lives, alleviating poverty, enhancing democratic governance, and supporting individuals in transitioning beyond aid [(USAID)](https://www.usaid.gov/about-us). One of USAID's initiatives involves providing medical assistance in the form of Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and HIV lab shipments to supported countries. This project explores a USAID dataset that provides supply chain health commodity shipment and pricing data related to the shipment of these drugs and testing kits to supported countries.

This project is undertaken in two parts:
1. **Data Preparation and Exploration**: Using Microsoft Excel to clean, prepare, and explore the dataset, documented in this Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Data Visualization**: Creating a dashboard using Tableau Desktop software to visualize the data. Access the dashboard [by clicking here](https://public.tableau.com/views/MedicalSupplyChainShipmentAnalysis/SCMDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Skills Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Tableau Desktop Software
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

## Data

The data used in this project was obtained from the [USAID Development Data Library (DDL)](https://data.usaid.gov/HIV-AIDS/Supply-Chain-Shipment-Pricing-Dataset/a3rc-nmf6/about_data). It provides the commodity pricing and associated supply chain expenses necessary to move the commodities to the supported countries. The dataset consists of 33 columns and 10,325 rows, covering the period from May 2006 to September 2015.

## Conclusion

We analyzed the supply chain shipment pricing data from USAID to answer key questions about the supply of medical supplies and offer insights to our supply chain stakeholders. Using Microsoft Excel, we meticulously cleaned the dataset and conducted the analysis, employing functions, pivot tables, and charts to present the data comprehensively.

### Key Findings

1. **Average Lead Time**: Afghanistan has the highest average lead time (164 days) for product delivery.
2. **Lead Time by Transportation Method**: Air transport shipments have an average lead time of 176 days, while truck shipments average 82 days.
3. **Spending by Product Group**: The most significant amount was spent on antiretroviral (ARV) drugs (1.42 billion USD).
4. **Top Brands by Number of Shipments**: Generic, Determine, and Uni-Gold are the top three brands based on the number of shipments.
5. **Largest Recipient by Item Value**: Nigeria received $350.27 million worth of supplies over the period.
6. **Transportation by Weight**: Most supplies (18.09 million kilograms) were transported via trucks.
7. **Largest Manufacturing Country**: India is the largest manufacturer of medical supplies delivered directly from vendors.
8. **Insurance Spending**: Most insurance spending (2.1 million USD) was on ARV drugs.

These findings provide valuable insights for stakeholders involved in decision-making regarding the supply chain of medical supplies to supported countries. Our study informs stakeholders about the spending on medical supplies, the main modes of transportation, the ranking of recipient countries, and the leading vendors in the supply chain.
